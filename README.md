In this assignment, I will be building an interactive dashboard to explore the captivating Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. This dataset serves as a comprehensive record of the multitude of microbes that inhabit human navels. One of the most remarkable findings in this dataset is that a select group of microbial species, also known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the study, were detected in more than 70% of individuals, while the remainder were relatively rare.

Features
The Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard offers a range of features to help me navigate and understand this fascinating dataset:

Bar Chart: A user-friendly bar chart that visually represents the distribution of microbial species (OTUs) in each sample. This chart provides a quick overview of the relative abundance of various OTUs in the selected sample.

Demographic Information: The dashboard displays essential demographic information about each subject, including age, gender, and ethnicity. This allows me to explore how these demographic factors might relate to the diversity of microbial life in human navels.

Bubble Chart: An interactive bubble chart provides an engaging way to explore the relationships between microbial species (OTUs) in terms of their abundance and presence across different samples. The size and color of the bubbles convey critical information about each OTU's prevalence and abundance.
